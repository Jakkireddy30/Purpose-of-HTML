<p>The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[1] It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[2]</p><br><br>
<p>The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[3][4] Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).</p>

<p>The original and still very common document type is a<a href="https://www.goegle.com">web page</a> formatted in <a href="https://www.goegle.com">Hypertext Markup Language </a>(HTML). This markup language supports <a href="https://www.goegle.com">plain text, images</a>, embedded <a href="https://www.firefox.com" >video</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com" >audio</a> contents, and <a href="https://www.insta.com" >scripts</a> (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports <a href="https://www.whatsaapweb.com">hyperlinks</a> (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. <a href="https://www.indiangovt.org">Web navigation</a>, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites.<a href="https://www.chrome.com">Web applications</a>  are web pages that function as<a href="https://www.snap.com">application software</a>. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the<a href="https://www.flipcart.com">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a>(HTTP). Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common<a href="https://www.apple.com">domain name</a> make up a<a href="https://www.apple.com">website</a> . A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and<a href="https://www.apple.com">individual users</a>; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.</p>
